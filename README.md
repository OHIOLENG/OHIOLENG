- 👋 Hi, I’m @OHIOLENG.The current occasion signifies my inaugural introduction to GitHub, and I am a neophyte in this realm.
- 👀 The direction of federated learning, particularly in terms of security, has piqued my professional interest.
- 💞️ I aspire to collaborate and engage in discussions with more proficient graduate students on this matter in order to salvage my field. Previously, I was involved in developing intelligent algorithms and processing extensive datasets(研究一些自作聪明的算法，跑一些可笑的数据).
